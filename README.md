# 1. Introduction

This document is a collection of profiles that define integration of authentication services with ISO 8583 used for financial transactions (e.g., point-of-sale (POS), automated teller machine (ATM) cash withdrawal transactions, etc.). Such services include biometric authentication (as defined by IEEE Std. 2410), PIN-based, Fast Identity Online (FIDO), and One-Time Password (OTP) and Time-based OTP (TOTP) authentication methods including risk and presentation attack defense (PAD) measures. The scope of authentication includes primary authentication, second-factor authentication (2FA), step-up authentication (SUA), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## 1.1. Requirements Notation and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.


Create a collection of standard profiles that define integration of
authentication services with ISO 8583 used for financial transactions
(e.g., point-of-sale (POS), automated teller machine (ATM) cash
withdrawal transactions, etc.). Such services include biometric
authentication (as defined by IEEE Std. 2410), PIN-based, Fast
Identity Online (FIDO), and One-Time Password (OTP) and Time-based OTP
(TOTP) authentication methods including risk and presentation attack
defense (PAD) measures. The scope of authentication includes primary
authentication, second-factor authentication (2FA), step-up
authentication (SUA), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
