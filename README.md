Create a collection of standard profiles that define integration of
authentication services with ISO 8583 used for financial transactions
(e.g., point-of-sale (POS), automated teller machine (ATM) cash
withdrawal transactions, etc.). Such services include biometric
authentication (as defined by IEEE Std. 2410), PIN-based, Fast
Identity Online (FIDO), and One-Time Password (OTP) and Time-based OTP
(TOTP) authentication methods including risk and presentation attack
defense (PAD) measures. The scope of authentication includes primary
authentication, second-factor authentication (2FA), step-up
authentication (SUA), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
